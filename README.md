# Escape From The Mire

_Escape From the Mire_ is a basic roguelike game made with pure vanilla javascript. The objective is to achieve the highest score possible before the player, inevitably, dies. On game start, a player is dropped at the center of a randomly generated maze-like map, along with a pet dog affectionately named Kublai. The player's main objective is then to find their way to one of the two randomly placed exits at the two (north/south) ends of the map. The player must also dodge (or attack) monsters, avoid traps, and maybe even pick up a treasure chest or 2 on their way. Should a player reach one of the exits, a new random map is generated and the process begins again. The player's score continues to accrue, until they die or exit the game. On restart the player is treated as an entirely new user, old arcade style.

Some key features of the game include:
- Randomly generated maps
- 5 character classes with unique abilities
- 3 monster types of varying difficulty with basic AI
- 2 static entities: a blood pool trap and a treasure chest
- 1 cute dog companion
